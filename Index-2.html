    <h3>
    <center>CSS is like HTML's support. CSS is used to style and move objects. Without CSS most websites would end up looking the same with the same font and same 
        colors. Some of the commands require you to do some stuff using html first.</center>

    <ul style="display:inline-block ; width:600px;">
        
        <li class="ra">When you want to style the whole webpage as a whole you would have to put all your code within a body command. body{<em>commands</em>}</li>
        
        <li>If you want to change the style of a certain phrase then first you would need to make an id for the phrase in html. Then instead of writing body, you should 
        write #<em>Whatever you named your id</em>{<em>commands</em>}</li>
        
        <li class="ra">If you want to change the style of multiple phrases then you need to add each phrase to a class in html. Then you would type .<em>whatever you named the
            class</em>{<em>commands</em>}</li>
        
        <li>background-color:<em>color</em>; changes the color of the background. If you want to fine tune your color you would end using background-color: rgb(<em>
            number,number,number</em>) Each number controlls one of the primarey colors.</li>
        
        <li class="ra">color:<em>color</em>; changes the color of the text. If you want to fine tune your color you would end using color: rgb(<em>
            number,number,number</em>) Each number controlls one of the primarey colors.</li>
        
        <li>font-size:<em>choose how big you want your text to be-represented in numbers-</em>px; This changes the size of the text. To make the text bigger, make the 
            number larger.</li>
        
        <li class="ra">font-family:<em>name of a font</em>; changes the font of the text</li>
        
        <li>width:<em>number</em>px(or %); changes the width of an image if it is under the id or class for images. If you use % instead of px then nomatter how big the 
        screen gets, the image will be in poportion with the size of the screen. You can do the same thing but for height by switching out the word width with height</li>
        
        <li class="ra">To make an image move you need to use multiple commands.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>position:absolute; will make it so that you can move the image</li>
            
            <li class="ra">float:left; makes it so that the image goes to the left of the page. If you want it to go to the right then you subsitute the left for a right. You can
            use this command without making the position absolute but that means you cant really move it around much.</li>
            
            <li>margin:<em>number</em>px(or %); gives the picture some extra room around the edges. It will keep the image off the wall and stuff like that. If you want
            to have the margin on one side then you would add a -<em>left,right,top,or bottom</em> to the margin before the :.</li>
            
            <li class="ra">top:<em>number</em>px; makes it so that the image is <em>the number you put in</em> away from the top of the page. you can subsitute the top for botton,
            left, or right to position your picture perfectly.</li>
            
            <li>z-index:<em>number</em>; orders the images so you can make them overlap however you want. A z-index of 1 would be on the bottom.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </ul>
