    <h1 >HTML</h1>
    <p>
    HTML is what is used to make webpages and it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is important because without it your website will not 
    show at all. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee. Most of this webpage is coded in HTML.
        There are many different commands used in HTML. </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="ra">In HTML when you start a command the way to end the command is by adding a / infront of the command but inside the &lt; and &gt;.</li>
        
        <li>&lt;p&gt; is used for adding paragraphs into your webpage. Like all the othe commands, &lt;/p&gt; is used to end the paragraph.</li>
        
        <li class="ra"> The command &lt;ul&gt; is used to make an unordered list. An unordered list uses bullet points instead of numbers for each phrase added.
        &lt;/ul&gt; is used to end the list.</li>
        
        <li> &lt;ol&gt; is used to make an ordered list. An ordered list numbers each point added instead of making bullet points. &lt;/ol&gt; is used 
            to end the list.</li>
        
        <li class="ra">&lt;li&gt; is used to add an item to a list. &lt;/li&gt; is used to end the item.</li>
        
        <li> &lt;h1&gt; is used is used to make a header. &lt;/h1&gt; is how you would end the header.</li>
        
        <li class="ra">&lt;body&gt; is the middle of your code. Images, words and all that stuff takes place in the body, &lt;/body&gt; ends it.</li>
        
        <li>To make an ID you would add id="<em>Name of ID</em>". You would add this inside of the beggining commad of what you wanted to change or add to.
        <strong> Example</strong>   &lt;p id="<em>Name of ID</em>"&gt; <em>Whatever you wrote about</em> &lt;p&gt;. This would mean that if you added 
        something to the ID you would change what you put inside the paragraph.</li>
        
        <li class="ra">If you wanted to add a link that goes to the bottom of your page you would first need to add an ID to where you want the link to take you to 
        within your webpage. Then you would add &lt;a href="#<em>Name of your ID</em>"&gt; <em>what you want your link to say</em>&lt;/a&gt; This will take 
        you to the ID you specified in the command. If you want the link to take you to another webpage you would just add the URL instead of the ID.</li>
        
        <li>If you want to group multiple, non connecting, things then you need to make something called a class. to make a class you need to put class="<em>name of class
            </em>"inside of the command before the phrases you want to group.
        </li>
        <li class="ra">If you want to add an image you have to use another command. &lt;img src="<em>url of image</em>"&gt;</li>
    </ul>
