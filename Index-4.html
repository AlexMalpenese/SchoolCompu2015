    <h1 >Computer</h1>
    <p>
    We took apart a Dell computer in class. The computer that we took apart didnt start in the beggining and it diddnt start afterward either. We still got to see 
    most of the components of the computer.</p>

    <p class="pic">This is what the computer looked when it is compleatly together before we touched anything. It looked like this

    <p class="pic">This is the notherboard of the computer. There was a lot of stuff that was on top of it and we had to clear it before
    we could actually take out the motherboard.</p>

    <p class="pic">This is the hard drive. It looks somewhat like the DVD player except that it is heavier and smaller.</p>

    <p class="pic">This is the DVD player. It was somewhat annoying to get out because it was stuck under other components and it was plugged into the motherboard.</p>
