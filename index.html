         <h3>
    I am in a Computer Science class where we learn about programming and other computer related stuff. I decided to take this class because I like computers and
        I want to become a computer engineer when I grow older. Me and my classmates take this class because it is a fun way to learn about proggramming with friends.
    We are currently learning about CSS and HTML. We also take apart a computer and try to put it back together again.</h3>
