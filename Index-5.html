<p>
    My name is Alex Malpenenese and I am currently a sophmore at Summit Prep. I like to travel to 
    multiple different countries in Europe. Two of my favorite things include dogs and
    books. I like dogs because they are adorable and I like books because they are interesting.
    I first started liking dogs when I first got a dog. I first started like books when I was in 
    thrid grade. 
    I am taking a class about programming and making this website is one of the 
    assignments. I decided to take this class because I wanted to learn how to 
    program. I want to build robots when I am older and being able to program the 
    robots I build will give me an upper hand in the real world.

    I have always been interested in building things. When I was younger I used to build 
    many lego creations. I had a ROZ robot building kit when I was younger and spent
    most of my time with it. I would build different creations then take them apart.
    I still like to build robots but now I use VEX robotics. Vex robotics involves screwing 
    peices of metal together and allows the users to build very complicated robots. They also
    have more complex sensors.
